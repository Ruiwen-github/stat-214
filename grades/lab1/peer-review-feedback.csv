"Sufficient comments are included to understand code., Consistent style is used.",Cleaning the data is reproducible with the file cleaning_data.py . Moreover there is a .ipynb file that allows to reproduce the figures.,Very easy with the function clean data in the separate file.,"The report is very readable, some small typos. ","the data cleaning process is discussed in details. Some judgment calls were made about imputing values for some missing values. It would have been helpful to get more details about that. Also in the report it is stated that : ""A table summarizing the specific imputation approach for each variable is attached at the end
of report."" but I couldn't find the table. ",The figures are relevant and discussed in the report ,The figure are in general visually appealing with labeled axes and easy to understand. However captions are usually not included. However a small remark in the use of histograms for showing proportions of ciTBI within some population group. In general we cannot read the proportion from the histogram since one bin is very small compared to the other. A suggestion would be to keep one bin and show inside this bin which proportion is ciTBI. Also changing the colors from the standard matplotlib ones could be a plus.,"The first finding is about feature correlations. The main message is that a subset features correlates well with ciTBI. There is also some intercorrelation but I think this is a less important finding. Therefore even if the figure is great, it looks a bit cumbersome and I would suggest to instead only plot correlations with ciTBI in a histogram for example since this is most important message/finding","The finding is interesting, we find that among lower GCS scores, the risk of ciTBI is higher compared to to the population of high GCS score. However I feel like the choice of the bins histogram for the figure is not the best, since we cannot see what is the proportion of ciTBI among each population (which was the main message to convey).","We find that falling from an elevation poses a higher risk of ciTBI across both age groups,
while others injury mechanisms are more relevant for specific age group. The finding is indeed interesting, however in the figure the axes labels are not explicit, they are numbers that we don't know to which mechanism they correspond. Thus it is a bit hard to read the message from the image",the reality check discusses the cleaning procedure and the findings and it very clearly described,The stability check is very well done with nice plots. ,Very good job
