Ruiwen Liu,3,ruiwenl@berkeley.edu,Ruiwen-github,"EDA: Good work! Feature Engineering: For feature importance results, it would have been helpful to interpret why those features are more useful. Autoencoder: This section was very well done. Your process was thorough and you described it well. Modeling: Well done, overall. Would have been nice to see a table comparing the models across different metrics. Stability Check: Should include a perturbation in one of the judgement calls you made during the modeling pipeline.",0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,3.0,2.5,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,8.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,60.5,93.08
