Lab 3.1
Team3 (Ruiwen Liu, Xiyue Liang, John Su, Xi Cheng)
This directory contains all code and environment setup for Lab 3.1.

Instructions: Before running the model code, please execute the three preprocessing .ipynb notebooks to generate the necessary embeddings.

To reduce memory usage during execution, lab3.1_bow.ipynb saves the Bag-of-Words (BoW) embeddings for each story individually as .npz files under the data/ folder. The modeling section in lab3.1_model_bow.ipynb will then load these pre-saved .npz files to train the model efficiently.

Additionally, a run.sh script is provided, which contains all the commands needed to reproduce our results end-to-end. Simply run the script to execute all required steps in the correct order.
