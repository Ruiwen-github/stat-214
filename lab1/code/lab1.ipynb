The primary goal of this report is to identify important clinical features to predict which patients with traumatic brain injueries (TBI) are at very low risk of clinically-important TBI (ciTBI) and can avoid unnecessar CT scans. This report is based on the study of \"*Identification of Children at Very Low Risk of Clinically-Important Brain Injuries After Head Trauma: A Prospective Cohort Study*\" by Nathan Kuppermann et al. (2009). The study developed evidence-based guidelines (PECARN rules) to help emergency departments decise when a CT scan is necessary for patients with head trauma.\n",

Finally, we will discuss the limitations of our analysis and potenial areas of improvement in applying these finding to real-orld settings."

Notably, GCS Total Score (`GCSTotal`) shows a negative correlation with ciTBI, with correlation coefficient of -0.52, indicating that patients with lower GCS scores are more likely to have ciTBI. This aligns with clinical expectations, as lower GCS scores suggest greater neurological impairment. Another feature showing a negative correlation with ciTBI is Normal Behavior (`ActNorm`), with coefficient -0.17, meaning that patients who are reported as acting normally are less likely to have ciTBI. This suggests that parental or clinical observations of abnormal behavior may serve as an early warning sign for serious head injuries.\n",

These variables include: Basilar Skull Fracture (`SFxBas`), Neurological Deficits (`NeuroD`), Palpable Skull Fracture (`SFxPalp`), and Loss of Consciousness (`LOCSeparate`). The result is reasonable because these features are documented risk factors for serious brain injury and are key factors in the PECARN prediciton rule.\n",

For example, Amnesia (Amnesia_verb) and Headache (HA_verb) are positively correlated, suggesting that patients experiencing amnesia are also more likely to report headaches. Similarly, GCS scores are correlated with normal behavior (ActNorm), meaning that patients with lower GCS scores are more likely to exhibit abnormal behavior. Another notable correlation is between GCS and Neurological Deficits (NeuroD), which makes sense as lower neurological deficit is often accompanied by a lower GCS score. These correlations suggest that some features capture overlapping clinical information, which should be considered when building a predictive model."

It indicates that patients with lower GCS scores are more likely to have ciTBI.

This suggests that injury mechanism should be interpreted differently based on age. It also supports the need for age-stratified risk assessment, as younger patients experience different injury patterns than older children, which could impact the likelihood of ciTBI."

Firstly, our dataset reports the proportion of ciTBI cases among all patients as 0.89%, which is very close to the prevalence rate mentioned in the original study. In addition, our analysis also relfects the relationshipsamong clinical features: patients with lower GCS scores are more likely to have serious brain injury, and ccting abnormally (`ActNorm`) is also negatively correlated with ciTBI, both of which are consistent with existing real-world expectations and domain knowledge.\n",

All these findings suggest that our cleaned dataset remains representative of actual clinical cases and matches with real-world expectations. While minor differences may exist due to missing value imputation, they do not appear to significantly impact overall trends. Therefore, we are confident that our cleaned data passes reality check and represent original dataset appropriately."

This aligns with the age-stratified approach we discussed before. For each age group, we split the dataset into 80% training and 20% testing sets, ensuring that the model was trained on a sufficient number of samples while keeping a testing set for evaluation. We selected Simple Decision Tree as our modeling approach because it has some important benefits: It is interpretable, allowing clinicians to understand how decisions are made; it handls non-linear relationships well, making them effective for clinical data; it naturally performs feature selection, focusing on the most important predictors.\n",

To avoid overfitting, we also made adjustments on hyperparameter including maximum depth, minimum sample leaf, and minimm sample split.\n",

        "In this study, we explored the prediction of clinically-important traumatic brain injuries (ciTBI) in patients using a dataset from the PECARN study. After thorough data preprocessing, including handling missing values, removing redundant features, and addressing class imbalance, we developed two separate decision tree models, one for younger patients (<2 years) and another for older patients (≥2 years), to reflect differences in injury mechanisms and clinical presentation. Both models achieved accuracy scores of 0.81, demonstrating reasonable predictive capability while maintaining interpretability for clinical use. Through exploratory analysis, we found that GCS scores, abnormal behavior, and skull fractures are strong indicators of ciTBI, while injury mechanisms differ between age groups but consistently show that fall from elevation is the most frequent among ciTBI cases. A stability check confirmed that these patterns hold even with perturbations in the data. This analysis can assist in reducing unnecessary CT scans while ensuring patient safety."
